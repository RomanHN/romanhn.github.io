[{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s the point of an interest-specific social club? To socialize, of course! With people who share a specific interest. I would argue this isn\u0026rsquo;t as obvious to people-organizers as it might sound.\nLast Friday, I attended a meetup with my university\u0026rsquo;s philosophy club. I went in expecting many opportunities to meet other thoughtful people, but I left the main event without seeing them. Instead, the meetup was a guided large group discussion about quotes from Emerson. While I did learn a lot by following the conversation, and it was somewhat entertaining, I was disappointed that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the chance to engage in more personal conversations and get to know the other members of the club.\nIf you get to decide what ~15 thoughtful people will do for two hours on a Friday afternoon, this is a rare opportunity, and you should be strategic about it. It represents 30 synchronous human-hours of opportunity cost, plus transportation. While you could use these hours to help people learn more about philosophy, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is the best use for the time. Rather, I believe human connection is more important. I could have learned about Emerson much more efficiently by reading the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, or been entertained more efficiently by taking a trip to an amusement park, for two hours. But instead, I blocked out that time because meeting the right person could have a huge positive impact on my life. I might make a great friend. We might spend a lot of quality time in the future. They could be a future romantic partner, or a professional connection. Indeed, I won\u0026rsquo;t have a better opportunity to meet lifelong friends than in college â€“Â in no other point of my life will I have as much time at my disposal to socialize and be in the same physical location as so many similar people in the same position. Meeting people has a huge mutual return on time investment.\nsmall group discussions are more fun and facilitate more interpersonal connections With this motivation in mind, how does one facilitate better mingling? My suggestion: structure your meetup to encourage small group discussions.\nMost people prefer talking to listening. The fewer people present in a conversation, the more space each person has to talk. (amount of talking)/(number of people) is larger, making the conversation more enjoyable. Smaller discussion groups give each person more control over the flow of the conversation, which also makes it more enjoyable. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to interject about things that you find interesting and ask questions about things you don\u0026rsquo;t know about. Talking to a smaller group allows you to speak less reservedly. It allows people to be more vulnerable and talk about things that have more personal significance. I see this as vital for interpersonal bonding. Smaller groups tend to talk about things that have less broad appeal. They give people the room to talk about more personal things and tell stories and anecdotes. Tautologically, you have to learn about the people around you to get to know them. how to encourage small group discussion One big conversation can be an equilibrium of your social event, depending on how you engineer the environment. I call this the \u0026ldquo;committee\u0026rdquo; style of conversation, and I see it as a failure mode. Once it reaches this point, it\u0026rsquo;s awkward to split it up. You have to find an opportunity to begin a private conversation with the people next to you, which can feel like talking over the person who\u0026rsquo;s currently speaking in the large group. Most people aren\u0026rsquo;t agentic or brash enough to step in the middle of the circle and announce \u0026ldquo;Okay guys, let\u0026rsquo;s split this conversation up. People on this side, go over here, and people on this side, stay here! ðŸ¤“\u0026rdquo;.\nSo you have to coordinate from the onset if you want a better conversation structure. Here are some ideas.\nInvite enough people so it can\u0026rsquo;t become a committee in the first place. A circle of 25 people would be so awkward and ridiculous that people will be forced to break off. Host the event in a place with enough room for people to spread out. Ideally, there will be different rooms or partly sheltered areas for some insulation between groups. If you\u0026rsquo;re the host, maybe it isn\u0026rsquo;t so brash to manually split up a large group if it forms. You could, for example, instruct guests to move to a different group when they hear a bell you ring every 30 minutes. This might bring a \u0026ldquo;forced\u0026rdquo; vibe to the party, but it also gives people plausible deniability when they want to leave a conversation. If they\u0026rsquo;re engaged, they\u0026rsquo;re totally allowed to ignore the bell and continue the conversation. But if they\u0026rsquo;re bored, they can say \u0026ldquo;Sorry, looks like I have to move to a new group. What can you do? But it was nice meeting you!\u0026rdquo;. Putting my money where my mouth is I don\u0026rsquo;t make this post to rag on the organizer of the philosophy club, or anyone else who has held a suboptimal social gathering. In fact, after the event, I pulled the philosophy club leader aside after the meeting to give him my thoughts constructively, and he was receptive to experimenting with a different structure for the next meeting. Different hosts have different goals for their events, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. I just value human connection a lot. It brings me a lot of joy when I witness two people meet and get along well because of something I initiated. I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to be cheesy â€“ it genuinely makes me super excited when I hear I\u0026rsquo;ve created a friendship.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve attended many social meetups in college so far, but recently I decided to step up and host two of my own, and my third and most ambitious is coming up in a few weeks. With each iteration, I\u0026rsquo;ve changed things to facilitate more interpersonal connection. The first party was awkward, reserved, and small, and I was late because I didn\u0026rsquo;t give myself enough time to prepare the food. The second was bigger, and I was ecstatic to see banter, deep conversation, and people exchanging contact information before they left, but it went too late into the night and still had a bit of a committee feel. The upcoming event will have even more people, take place in a small building with partially insulated rooms to break up potential committees, and have a definitive closing point.\nI hope this post inspired you to think critically about how to help people meet each other. Those with an entrepreneurial spirit towards socializing, go forth and foster connections!\n","permalink":"https://roman.computer/discussions/","summary":"What\u0026rsquo;s the point of an interest-specific social club?

Anyone can claim that they\u0026rsquo;re romanhn on GitHub, but only I know my GitHub password. But if a hacker breaches GitHub\u0026rsquo;s servers and publishes a list of everyone\u0026rsquo;s password,1 knowing my password is no longer proof of anything. This is the motivation behind two- or multi-factor authentication (MFA): to access my GitHub account, not only would you have to know my password, but you\u0026rsquo;d need to authenticate yourself using an additional factor, like tapping a notification on my phone.\nadapted from sketchplanations\nI\u0026rsquo;ll use the \u0026ldquo;Swiss cheese model\u0026rdquo;, shown above, to explain how multi-factor authentication provides security through redundancy. If a hacker can bypass one hole (knows my password) they have to find a hole in another layer (get me to tap the notification) in order to hack my account.\ncategories of factors A user can use any of three categories of factors to authenticate themself:2\nA piece of information only they know, like a password or PIN. A physical object only they possess, like a key or security token. A physical characteristic only they display, like a fingerprint or voice pattern. Each layer should be a different category because different factors in the same category are often breached simultaneously, as if they were sliced from the same section of the cheese block so their holes were in similar places. For example, if I fell victim to a phishing attack, the hacker would discover all the \u0026ldquo;pieces of information only I know\u0026rdquo; in one fell swoop. Asking the hacker \u0026ldquo;what was the name of your first pet?\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide any additional security if they discovered my password and my first pet\u0026rsquo;s name at the same time.\nThis is the same idea behind the 3-2-1 rule for backing up data.\nYou should maintain three copies of anything you care about: two copies in different formats and one off-site backup.\nLike with authentication, redundancy in backups is best when it is spread across different modalities. Instead of protecting against a phishing attack, however, it prevents a house fire from wiping out your baby photo collection because you never stored a copy in the cloud.\nthe problem with MFA While MFA makes it harder for a hacker to breach an account, it also makes it easier for a legitimate user to get locked out. People lose their cell phones and biometric sensors fail, all the time. And this matters because getting locked out is often worse than your account being hacked â€“ I would rather let a hacker download all of the data in my Google Photos account than lose access to it permanently.\nSuppose that a laptop can be accessed using three authentication factors (entering a password, confirming via an SMS text, and scanning a fingerprint), and they each have false positive (hacker successfully bypasses) and false negative (a user fails to pass) rates of 1%. Different multi-factor authentication schemes combining these factors have new rates, as shown by the confusion matrices below.3\nonly password required user access granted access denied legitimate 99.00% 1.00% hacker 1.00% 99.00% password and SMS required user access granted access denied legitimate 98.01% 1.99% hacker 0.01% 99.99% password, SMS, and fingerprint required user access granted access denied legitimate ~97.03% ~2.97% hacker 0.0001% 99.9999% With each additional factor, the chance that a hacker could successfully break in decreases exponentially (1% -\u0026gt; 0.01% -\u0026gt; 0.001%). However, the chance that a legitimate user gets locked out increases ~linearly (1% -\u0026gt; 1.99% -\u0026gt; ~2.97%). The probability that \u0026ldquo;something bad happens\u0026rdquo; is actually greater when three factors are required instead of two.4\nthe 2/3 rule To combat against false negatives and false positives simultaneously, I propose the \u0026ldquo;2/3 rule\u0026rdquo; for multi-factor authentication:\nA system should have in place three methods, in different modalities, for authenticating a legitimate user. The user is granted access to the system as long as they can pass at least two out of the three methods.5\nThis provides redundancy on both fronts: a malicious actor must crack at least two methods to breach an account, and a legitimate user must fail at least two methods to be locked out. It\u0026rsquo;s like a castle with a moat and cannons to thwart invaders, as well as guardrails and nets to prevent the king from falling into the moat.\nThe confusion matrix for this combination demonstrates how the 2/3 strategy provides symmetric redundancy:\nat least two of password, TOTP, or fingerprint user access granted access denied legitimate ~99.97% ~0.03% hacker ~0.03% ~99.97% While the chance that a hacker breaks into a 2/3 system is higher than the original 2- or 3-factor systems (~0.03% \u0026gt; 0.01% \u0026gt; 0.0001%), the chance that a user gets locked out is dramatically lower, even more so than the 1-factor system (0.03% \u0026lt; 1.00%). This means that the overall chance of being hacked or locked out is lower than any other system.\nthis is nothing new That being said, this strategy is already in use; I just wanted to give a name to it. For example, if you have 2-factor authentication enabled on your Google or Facebook accounts, they will allow you to receive a code from a text message in case you don\u0026rsquo;t have your TOTP generator on you.\nOkay, a more realistic situation is \u0026ldquo;a hacker breaches GitHub\u0026rsquo;s servers, downloads a list of everyone\u0026rsquo;s password hashes, cracks the easiest ones, and sells the list to another hacker on some forum\u0026rdquo;, but the same idea holds.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThere are other categories like \u0026ldquo;somewhere you are\u0026rdquo;, which is measured by the user\u0026rsquo;s IP address at the time of login.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe probability that a legitimate user is denied access is $1-0.99^n$ , where $n$ is the number of factors required. Similarly, the probability that a hacker is granted access is $0.01^n$ . This model becomes more complicated if different factors have different false positive/negative rates or are combined in different ways (for example, one scheme could require either a password or a fingerprint).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis explicitly assumes that any given login attempt has an equal chance of being malicious or legitimate, and it implicitly assumes that the \u0026ldquo;hacked\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;locked out\u0026rdquo; events are equally bad. Neither of these assumptions are true for most systems.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUsing the fourth category of authentication factors \u0026ldquo;location\u0026rdquo;, one could implement a \u0026ldquo;2/4\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;3/4\u0026rdquo; strategy.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://roman.computer/mfa/","summary":"multi-factor authentication When you sign into an online service, you\u0026rsquo;re required to provide a username to identify who you are and a password to prove that you are who you say you are.
